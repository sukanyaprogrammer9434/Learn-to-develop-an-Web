<p><b>We are the teens,who studied on Computer Science for,</p><p>like 2/3years.And have the ability to teach you too.For teenages,you have to explain more,to make them understand something,<p>than the adults,as the brains of juniors/teens are also teens too,we were taught Computer Science in that way.</p>
<p>As, our brains were teen too.</p><p>So,when we'll explain,shouldn't it be more explained,than you were needed to explain.(Talking about adults).Now, if you're a junior,</p><p>then it should be more amazing,to teach you our junior member!We shall try our best. </p>
